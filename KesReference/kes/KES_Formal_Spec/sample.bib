abstract="We construct the first efficient forward-secure digital signature scheme where the total number of time periods for which the public key is used does not have to be fixed in advance. The number of time periods for which our scheme can be used is bounded only by an exponential function of the security parameter (given this much time, any scheme can be broken by exhaustive search), and its performance depends (minimally) only on the time elapsed so far. Our scheme achieves excellent performance overall, is very competitive with previous schemes with respect to all parameters, and outperforms each of the previous schemes in at least one parameter. Moreover, the scheme can be based on any underlying digital signature scheme, and does not rely on specific assumptions. Its forward security is proven in the standard model, without using a random oracle. As an intermediate step in designing our scheme, we propose and study two general composition operations that can be used to combine any existing signature schemes (whether standard or forward-secure) into new forward-secure signature schemes.",

abstract = {We describe a digital signature scheme in which the public key is fixed but the secret
signing key is updated at regular intervals so as to provide a forward security property:
compromise of the current secret key does not enable an adversary to forge signatures
pertaining to the past. This can be useful to mitigate the damage caused by key exposure
without requiring distribution of keys. Our construction uses ideas from the Fiat-Shamir
and Ong-Schnorr identification and signature schemes, and is proven to be forward
secure based on the hardness of factoring, in the random oracle model. The construction
is also quite efficient.},
